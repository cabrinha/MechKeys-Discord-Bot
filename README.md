This is a bot I wrote in python to assist me in administrating the Reddit Mechanical Keyboards Discord Server.

Functions Include-
- Adding roles by keyword.
- Purging messages.
- Hiding channels on command.
- A simple vote function using emoji reactions.
- Tracking server activity (message count and active members) - WIP with overhaul
- Raffle function that select members who reacted to a message.

## Thanks to:
- [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) the API Wrapper Used
- [Mee6](https://github.com/cookkkie/mee6) Served a guide to build my plugin system.
